        <p class="card-text">
          Videogames are a huge part of my life. I have been playing games since
          I was little and had multiple consoles back then. A few years ago, I
          was able to buy a gaming pc and my journey discovering new games has
          been amazing. My favorite genre is Survival, they are extremely fun
          specially with friends.

        <p class="card-text">
          My cat's name is Kuki and he is almost 5 years old. I found him on the
          streets in December 2019 and I took him in. He's the love of my life.
          Loves playing, eating tuna and sleeping. Kuki is well-behaved and
          sometimes shy with strangers.
